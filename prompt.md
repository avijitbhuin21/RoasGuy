I will be giving you some figma css with the screenshot of the visual design for mobile menu.

You need to edit this @advanced_homepage.html @advancedHomePage.css and achieve the target visual design for mobile menu without changing any desktop view design

Use the colors that is already defined for light and dark modes, don't change anything if there is no need to do that
